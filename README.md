# Detection of diabetic retinopathy using deep learning on eye retina images

- Diabetic retinopathy is a serious eye condition that can even lead to blindness in diabetic patients. It has been identified as the leading cause of blindness among adults. So it becomes extremely important to detect diabetic retinopathy at an early stage using retinal images.

- The manual diagnosis of DR takes time and effort and is prone to errors.

- We intend to propose a deep learning based solution to automatically detect and classify diabetic retinopathy by examining the images of eye retina taken using fundus cameras.
